<H3>Parse-to-execute-Ratio</H3>
<TABLE WIDTH="95%" ALIGN="center"><TR><TD CLASS="text">
 <P>Since parsing is an expensive operation, the goal should be to keep its
 count as low as possible. Best is to parse once and execute many. But what
 does this mean? If you have a high parse ratio (i.e. "Execute to Parse" is
 very low), you might want to discover its reason. For this first have a look
 at what parsing means. Parsing includes the following steps:</P>
 <OL><LI>Make a syntax check on the SQL statement</LI>
     <LI>Make a semantic check (i.e. check that the refered tables, views,
         etc. exist)</LI>
     <LI>Make a security check (i.e. look that the "executer" has permission
         on the refered objects)</LI>
     <LI>Generate an execution plan</LI></OL>
 <P>Thus if a parse call fails (which is likely to be the case if you have
 more parses than executes), this can be due to 3 different reasons:</P>
 <UL><LI>Syntax errors in your SQL statement(s)</LI>
     <LI>Refering to not existing (or invalid) objects</LI>
     <LI>Missing <code>GRANT</code>s</LI></UL>
 <P>What else can lead to unnecessary parsing? For this the question is first
 what time a parse is needed to be done. If Oracle successfully completes
 parsing, the statement will be stored to the SQLArea, together with its
 execution plan. So if we call the same statement again, it will be found in
 this "cache", the parsing step can be skipped, and we can go straight to
 execute the statement. But what is recognized to be the same statement? It
 must be the exact same spelling (even case makes a difference!), so
 <code>select sysdate from dual;</code> and <code>SELECT sysdate FROM dual;</code>
 are two different statements. And of course, including a <code>WHERE</code>
 clause makes a difference if you write <code>WHERE sample=5</code> and in
 the next statement <code>WHERE sample=7</code>. For this, you should make
 use of bind variables: <code>WHERE sample=:B1</code> does not need to be
 parsed again even if you substitute a different value for :B1.</P>
 <P>One more thing that may unnecessarily increase parsing is an application
 that frequently discards cursors. If you have no influence on the application,
 it may be helpful to create a "cursor cache" in your database. For this issue,
 you may use the <code>SESSION_CACHED_CURSORS</code> parameter. You also may
 want to have a look at the <A HREF="softparse.html">soft parse</A> issue to
 seehow the <code>CURSOR_SHARING</code> parameter may be helpful.</P>
 <P>Another hint is to use stored procedures whenever it is possible.
 Multiple users issuing the same stored code use the same shared PL/SQL area
 automatically. Because stored procedures are stored in a parsed form, their
 use reduces runtime parsing.</P>

 <H4>Identify relevant statements</H4>
 <P>You now may ask how to identify relevant statements. Remember: A "good"
 statement is parsed once and then executed many times - a "bad" statement
 is executed once per parse (i.e. always parsed before execute) - a "very bad"
 statement is just parsed and never executed. I.e. we are searching for
 statements where the parses are higher or equal to the executes:</P>
 <PRE CLASS="code">SELECT sql_text "Statement", parse_calls "Parses", executions "Executions", "Ratio" FROM (
  SELECT sql_text, parse_calls, executions, round(parse_calls/executions,2) "Ratio"
    FROM v$sql
   WHERE parse_calls/executions >= 1 AND executions>0
  UNION
  SELECT sql_text, parse_calls, executions, 100000 "Ratio"
    FROM v$sql
   WHERE executions = 0 and parse_calls >0
 )
 ORDER BY "Ratio" DESC, "Executions" ASC, "Parses" DESC;</PRE>
 <P>This should list up the candidates, starting with the worst ones - so the
 result set ot that query should really help you to identify the evildoers.</P>
 <P>For more details, please also see the explanations on <A HREF='parse.html'>Parsing</A>
 for the <I>Top SQL by Parse Count</I> statistics.</P>
