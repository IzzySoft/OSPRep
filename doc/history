==================

v0.0.1 (03.11.2003) initial version
-----------------------------------
+ Output intro: Common instance information
+ simple SnapShot info (id, time, comment)

v0.0.2 (04.11.2003)
-------------------
+ collecting statspack report info via statspack.stat_changes
+ added Session and Cursor/Session to SnapShot Info
+ added Cache Sizes and Load Profile
+ added Instance Efficiency Percentages
+ added Shared Pool Stats

v0.0.3 (05.11.2003)
-------------------
+ added Top 5 Wait Events
+ added All Wait Events
+ added BG Wait Events
+ added Top n SQL by Gets

v0.0.4 (06.11.2003)
-------------------
* a little code cleanup
+ added Top n SQL by Reads / Exec / Parse
+ made "n" (for the Top-N Stats) a config var
+ added Instance Activity Stats
+ added TableSpace IO Summary Stats
+ added FileIO Summary Stats

v0.0.5 (07.11.2003)
-------------------
+ added Buffer Pool Stats
+ added Instance Recovery Statistics
+ added Buffer Wait Statistics
+ added PGA Stats
+ added Enqueue Activity
+ added RBS Stats
+ added Undo Stats
+ added Latch Stats
+ added Cache Stats

v0.0.6 (10.11.2003)
-------------------
+ added SGA stats
+ added Resource Limits
+ added Init Params
! SnapShot Info now regards dbid and instnum

v0.0.7 (11.11.2003)
-------------------
+ added possibility to auto-evaluate the latest possible SnapShot interval
+ -"- up to a specified Snap_End (only Start_ID will be eval'd)
* some descriptions changed (th)
+ Start/End ID can be specified at / overridden from CmdLine
+ added some more comments to the configuration settings of OSPRep
+ created version for Oracle 9.2
! pctSGA (for Dictionary Cache block) was not shown due to error in SQL
  statement. Fixed.

v0.0.8 (11.11.2003)
-------------------
+ modularized spreport.sh - it now consists of multiple files. spreport.sh
  itself remains as a wrapper, the real script is generated at runtime. This
  is due to different parameter structure in the call to the collector
  procedure of Oracle StatsPack itself between the versions, so:
  OSPRep now supports Oracle StatsPack for v9.0 AND 9.2
+ added interface for Oracle v8.1.7 (untested!)
! due to insufficient formatting, hash marks (#) could be displayed instead
  the real values in some cases
! some Shell variables still remained in a place they could not be replaced
  any more

v0.1.0 (12.11.2003)
-------------------
+ added example output
+ added some docu

v0.1.1 (16.11.2003)
-------------------
+ optimization: wrote wrapper for dbms_output.put_line
* moved some hardcoded font formatting to stylesheet
* some code cleanup
! fixed Optim W/A Execs in PGA stats (statement from Oracle Statspack
  didn't work correctly - replaced by own statement)

v0.1.2 (25.11.2003)
-------------------
+ added HitRatio to Buffer Pool Stats
+ additional procedure (and table) for statspack to gather information on
  wait objects is included now. Table needs to be installed into the perfstat
  schema, the procedure needs the SYS schema - see docs and files for details.
  Installing this is optional.
+ enhanced buffer wait stats (including tuning tips)
+ added hints/comments to TS/File IO stats, wait events, Top-N SQL statements,
  enqueue activity, RBS stats and Library Cache stats

v0.1.3 (02.12.2003)
-------------------
+ added hints/comments to Instance Efficiency section
+ more comments/hints on latches
+ added execution plan to Top-N-SQL (when found ;)
+ introduced new config var: EXC_PERF_FOR lists up users whose objects
  should be excluded from performance statistics (makes no sense to e.g.
  report about the execution plan for operations on the data dictionary
  since one either cannot or at least should not change those objects).
  These settings are only used where applicable. As for now, that is for the
  execution plans plus for objects causing waits. In the latter place you
  will find a note what was excluded.

v0.1.4 (10.12.2003)
-------------------
! fixed a bug in get_plan() that broke the job if a statement had multiple
  execution plans (in that case, we make sure to display the latest now)
+ now including full execution plan "tree"
+ formating enhancements for plan table
+ added enqueue type descs plus tuning hints
+ enhanced description for wait events

v0.1.5 (19.12.2003)
-------------------
+ new AddOn for datafile growth statistics
! fixed another bug in get_plan() that broke the job if a statement had multiple
  execution plans
! PctChange for datafile growth statistics had wrong base (files got smaller ;)
* increased number length for buffer waits
* outsourced verbose hints to external help files (and made them even more
  verbose ;)
+ updated the doc/readme.txt concerning the installation instructions

v0.1.6 (05.01.2004)
-------------------
* one more digit for pctChange on data file growth (may now grow up to 9999.99%)
+ added external help file for rollback segment stats
+ added external help file for undo segment stats
+ more detailled help on latch statistics
+ more detailled help on library cache statistics (external help file now)

v0.1.7 (09.01.2004)
-------------------
* execution plans are now also displayed for statements w/o cost (sometimes
  the optimizer misses to display costs)
+ added fts_plans.sh to retrieve execution plans for all statements causing
  Full Table Scans (FTS) - these are mostly indicators for optimization, e.g.
  index creation etc.
+ updated doc/readme.txt on PlugIns
* increased digits for pctchange in SGA Breakdown

v0.1.8 (19.01.2004)
-------------------
+ added some enqueue types to help file
+ added PctMiss and PctSleep to Latch Sleep Breakdown block
+ added PctFail to Enqueue Activity block
+ enhanced command line syntax: now you can override some of the default
  options from the "config" file (e.g. user, passwd) at the command line
  (thanx to Manuel Soriano for this suggestion incl. code sent for OraRep)

v0.1.9 (22.01.2004)
-------------------
! file names could get messed up when different SID/Connect string was specified
  on commandline with parameter "-s"
* adapted new command line syntax on fts_plans.sh
* if user provided BEGIN_SNAP_ID (with "-b") but no END_SNAP_ID (with "-e")
  the report could go nuts; prevented this assuming EID=BID for these cases
* some CleanUp of directory structure (moving all files from the plugins/
  directory to install/ [since only needed for install], and all "plugins" to
  the plugins/ directory for cleaner structs and preparation of modularization
+ blocks that may be not needed on a regular basis can now be excluded (or
  included) on demand - see the "config" file for details
* Resource Limits table is now only created if content exists for it
+ new command line parameter "-c" to specify alternative config file
! some temporary files have not been cleaned up after run

v0.2.0 (02.02.2004)
-------------------
+ added documentation (see doc/html/ directory)
+ added description for "Execute to Parse" ratio ("Efficiency" block)
+ added "Go4Colors Mode" for Datafiles Statistics, Instance Efficiency,
  Top_N_SQL (FTS in execution plans), TS IO Summary, File IO Summary,
  Library Cache

v0.2.1 (16.02.2004)
-------------------
+ more verbous explanation for cursor sharing
* some formatting updates for the help files
+ added (cumulative) charts for selected system events (use charts.sh to create
  them)

v0.2.2 (19.02.2004)
-------------------
* M$IE had some problems with formatting of the charts - worked around it
+ added enqueue waits to waitobject gatherer
+ added Delta- & Ratio- charts: (current) Logons and Opened Cursors,
  Freebuffers inspected/requested, Chained-Fetch-Ratio (Ratio charts). Delta-
  charts have the same items as cumulative charts.
+ added AvgCharts (cumulative: timeouts per snapshot)
* updated the (HTML) documentation

v0.2.3
-------------------
! cosmetical fix: description of initial diagram of Ratio charts fixed
! fixed division by zero error in buffer pool stats
