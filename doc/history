+ added some more comments to the configuration settings of OSPRep
+ created version for Oracle 9.2
! pctSGA (for Dictionary Cache block) was not shown due to error in SQL
  statement. Fixed.

v0.0.8 (11.11.2003)
-------------------
+ modularized spreport.sh - it now consists of multiple files. spreport.sh
  itself remains as a wrapper, the real script is generated at runtime. This
  is due to different parameter structure in the call to the collector
  procedure of Oracle StatsPack itself between the versions, so:
  OSPRep now supports Oracle StatsPack for v9.0 AND 9.2
+ added interface for Oracle v8.1.7 (untested!)
! due to insufficient formatting, hash marks (#) could be displayed instead
  the real values in some cases
! some Shell variables still remained in a place they could not be replaced
  any more

  didn't work correctly - replaced by own statement)

v0.1.2 (25.11.2003)
-------------------
+ added HitRatio to Buffer Pool Stats
+ additional procedure (and table) for statspack to gather information on
  wait objects is included now. Table needs to be installed into the perfstat
  schema, the procedure needs the SYS schema - see docs and files for details.
