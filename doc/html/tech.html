 <tr><td class="text">
  OSPRep is written using PL/SQL and Unix Shell. While PL/SQL code is used to
  retrieve the information from the Oracle Database, Unix Shell code is used to
  construct the (anonymous) PL/SQL block (which is then executed) based on the
  users configuration. This way I realized the modular structure of OSPRep, just
  including those constructs in the finally executed code that we really need
  to execute, thus limiting the overhead e.g. for unnecessary parsing.

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="plugins"></a>Collector PlugIns</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  With OSPRep v0.1.2 I started to include collector plugins - i.e. modules
  additional to Oracle Statspack to gather more statistical data; not to confuse
  with the elements to be found in the <code>plugins/</code> directory of the
  distribution. The latter ones are plugins used by the report generator, while
  the first ones are used to gather the statistics. Right now, there are two of
  these collector plugins available: one for gathering "Wait Objects" statistics,
  the other for collecting information on data file growth.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  In order to use these collector plugins, you of course have to install them
  first. For this, there are four SQL files available within the <code>install/</code>
  directory. Instructions are to be found within the head of these files. After
  having them installed, don't forget to include a call to their procedures
  together with the <code>statspack.snap()</code> call (the <code>get_waitevents</code>
  and <code>get_fileinfo</code> procedures should be run directly after each
  snapshot.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="require"></a>Requirements</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  The requirements can directly be derived from the above paragraph and the
  intended goal: First, you need an Oracle Database Server up and running,
  otherwise there's nothing we can retrieve the information to report on. Second,
  the instance(s) of this Database Server Oracle Statspack is installed into (i.e.
  the ones holding a <code>PERFSTAT</code> schema OSPRep shall read information
  from) need to have PL/SQL installed, otherwise the code generated by OraRep
  cannot be processed by them. Third, you need the Oracle Statspack to be
  installed and set up, plus having <code>statspack.snap()</code> run at least
  two times to gather some data OSPRep can report on. And last but not least,
  you need a Unix Shell (OraRep works fine with the Bash Shell - other Shells
  have not been tested but may work as well). This does imply that OSPRep does
  run in *nix environments (Linux, Solaris, AIX, etc. - successfully tested just
  with RedHat Linux 7.x, other reports are welcome). There are Shell environments
  available for Windows as well, like with CygWin - but since I didn't test
  OraRep in those environments I cannot guarantee that it will run with them;
  again, reports are welcome.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="lim"></a>Limitations</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  OSPRep was tested successfully with Oracle versions 9.0.1 and 9.2 - which
  does not necessarily mean it will not run with other versions. As always,
  reports are very welcome especially if you successfully use OSPRep with Oracle
  versions &lt; 9.0.1 or &gt; 9.2, so I can correct this limitation here. For
  other limitations, please read the previous paragraph (Shell, PL/SQL, OSes).
