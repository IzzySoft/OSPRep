 <tr><th>Installation</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  The following instructions assume that all requirements mentioned in the
  <a href="tech.html#require">Requirements</a> section of this documentation are
  met. Especially: an Oracle Database Server up and running, having Oracle
  Statspack installed.

   <li><b>Create a directory where the generated reports shall be stored in.</b>
       This directory should be below your web servers <code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code>,
       if you intend to serve the reports using an IntraNet or InterNet web site.</li>
   <li><b>Create a directory for the Online Help pages.</b> This directory must
       be located below the one created in step 1 and must be named <code>help</code>.</li>
   <li><b>Create a directory for the scripts.</b> This directory must <b>NOT</b>
       be below your web servers document root but in a somehow safe place, only
       accessible by authorized users. This directory is referenced to as
       "<code>~/scripts</code>" from now on.</li>
   <li><b>Unpack the archive</b> into the <code>~/scripts</code> directory. Make sure
       to retain the directory structure inside the archive. A safe way to do so
       is to copy the <code>osprep*.tgz</code> file to the target directory,
       change into this directory and run the command <code>tar xzf osprep*.tgz</code>.</li>
   <li><b>Edit the configuration file</b> to reflect your systems settings. The
       default configuration file is named <code>config</code> and to be found
       within the <code>~/scripts</code> directory. For details on this step, see
       the chapter on <a href="config.html">configuration</a>.</li>
   <li><b>Create the help pages.</b> To do so, change to the <code>~/scripts/install</code>
       directory and run the <code>mkhelp.sh</code> script located there. This
       will process the template (<code>*.tpl</code>) files and generate HTML
       files out of them, which will be placed into the <code>help/</code>
       directory created in step 2. Other files needed there (as e.g. the help
       icon) will be copied as well. Optionally set up the
       <a href="tech.html#plugins">Collector Plugins</a> from this directory
       as well.</li>
   <li>In six days G*d created the heavens and the earth (see Gen 1+2) - the
       seventh day is Shabbat, and He rested. So get yourself a cup of coffee,
       tea, or whatever drink you like, and <b>relax</b> for a moment - your
       (installation) work is done!</li>
  </ol>

  Now that you succeeded up to this point, continue with the
  <a href="usage.html">usage</a> page to read important things about how to
  call the <code>~/scripts/sreport.sh</code> and <code>~/scripts/fts_plans.sh</code>
  scripts. Maybe after a while you want to fine-tune your setup: read more about
  that on the <a href="config.html">configuration</a> page.
