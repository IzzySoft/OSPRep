 <tr><th>Installation</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  The following instructions assume that all requirements mentioned in the
  <a href="tech.html#require">Requirements</a> section of this documentation are
  met. Especially: an Oracle Database Server up and running.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="fullinst"></a>Installing OSPRep and Oracle StatsPack by script</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  If you have not yet installed the StatsPack (as delivered by Oracle) into
  your database - no problem: We make this easy for you providing a script
  doing all the needed work, including the installation of the OSPRep extensions
  you wish to use. To do so, the following steps are required:
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  <ol>
   <li>Change to the install/ directory (below the place where you unpacked
       OSPRep into)</li>
   <li>Open the file <code>spcreate.sh</code> with your favorite editor</li>
   <li>In the configuration section, adjust the settings to reflect your needs</li>
   <li>Save and execute the script</li>
  </ol>
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  To verify the successfully execution, a few logfiles will be created: One
  explicitely by <code>spcreate.sh</code>, and a few more implicitely by the
  Oracle scripts called.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  If you already had the StatsPack installed, you may want to add some of the
  extensions manually. Please obey the order of execution in those places, where
  multiple scripts are to be run for one extension:
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  <ol>
   <li>File Statistics: <code>install/database/fileobj.sql</code> and
       <code>install/database/getfilestat.sql</code></li>
   <li>Session Statistics: <code>install/database/get_sesstat.sql</code></li>
   <li>Wait Statistics: <code>install/database/waitobj.sql</code> and
       <code>install/database/getwaits.sql</code></li>
  </ol>
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Furthermore, make sure the needed data are collected <b><i>after</i></b>
  each snapshot is taken (again, the <code>spcreate.sh</code> will set this
  up for you if you used it). In the database job creating your snapshot, you
  need to add the appropriate lines <b><i>after</i></b> the call to
  <code>statspack.snap</code>:
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">

   <li>File Statistics: <code>get_fileinfo</code></li>
   <li>Session Statistics: <code>get_sesstat</code></li>
   <li>Wait Statistics: <code>get_waitevents</code></li>
  </ol>
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="awr"></a>Using the AWR compatibility layer</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
    Starting with OSPRep v0.4.5, a basic "compatibility layer" to the AWR (Auto
    Workload Repository) of Oracle 10g was added. So if you are running Oracle 10g,
    and do not want to install StatsPack in addition to the already included AWR,
    this may be an option for you.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
    There are still some restrictions and limitations (see the introductional
    comments in <code>install/database/awr_setup.sql</code>), but many things are
    already covered.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
    In order to be able to generate OSPRep reports based on AWR data, you first
    need to establish the compatibility layer. That is, in general, emulating
    the StatsPack tables by creating corresponding views, plus the minimal PL/SQL
    stuff. For this, you need to complete the following steps:
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
   <ol>
    <li><b>Create a new database user</b> with at least the same privileges as PERFSTAT
        usually gets. Of course you may also use an existing one matching these
        conditions, but take care NOT to have ANY StatsPack objects installed with
        this user (especially not running <code>spcreate.sql</code> and the like),
        for those are conflicting with the compatibility layer.</li>
    <li><b>Change to the <code>install/database</code> directory</b> of the extracted OSPRep sources</li>
    <li><b>Use SQL*Plus</b> to connect to the user created in step 1, and execute the script
        <code>@awr_setup.sql</code> &ndash; you should see the progress of creating the
        layer, but no error messages.</li>
    <li>Remember to <b>configure OSPRep</b> (in the <code>config</code> file, or later using command
        line options) to connect to this user</li>
    <li>While in the configuration (the <code>config</code> file), <b>check the settings against
        the "problematic ones"</b> mentioned in <code>awr_setup.sql</code> as e.g. "not yet working",
        and make sure to disable them. Otherwise, report generation will most likely fail.</li>
   </ol>
 </td></tr>

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="ospsetup"></a>Setting up OSPRep</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Now we can go to setup OSPRep itself:
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  <ol>
   <li><b>Create a directory where the generated reports shall be stored in.</b>
       This directory should be somewhere below your web servers
       <code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code>, if you intend to serve the reports using an
       IntraNet or InterNet web site.</li>
   <li><b>Create the directories for the Web-Includes.</b> They must be located
       directly below (i.e. "in") the one created in step 1 and must be named
       <code>help</code> (for the Online Help pages) and <code>inc</code> for
       the code snippets.</li>
   <li><b>Create a directory for the scripts.</b> This directory must <b><i>NOT</i></b>
       be below your web servers document root but in a somehow safe place, only
       accessible by authorized users. This directory is referenced to as
       "<code>~/scripts</code>" from now on.</li>
   <li><b>Unpack the archive</b> into the <code>~/scripts</code> directory. Make sure
       to retain the directory structure inside the archive. A safe way to do so
       is to copy the <code>osprep*.tgz</code> file to the target directory,
       change into this directory and run the command <code>tar xzf osprep*.tgz</code>.</li>
   <li><b>Edit the configuration file</b> to reflect your systems settings. The
       default configuration file is named <code>config</code> and to be found
       within the <code>~/scripts</code> directory. For details on this step, see
       the chapter on <a href="config.html">configuration</a>.</li>
   <li><b>Create the Web-Includes.</b> To do so, change to the
       <code>~/scripts/install</code> directory and run the <code>mkhelp.sh</code>
       script located there. This will process the template (<code>*.tpl</code>)
       files and generate the HTML help pages out of them, which will be placed
       into the <code>help/</code> directory created in step 2. Other files needed
       there (as e.g. the help icon) will be copied to their location as well as
       the code snippets. Optionally set up the
       <a href="tech.html#plugins">Collector Plugins</a> from this directory.</li>
   <li>In six days G*d created the heavens and the earth (see Gen 1+2) - the
       seventh day is Shabbat, and He rested. So get yourself a cup of coffee,
       tea, or whatever drink you like, and <b>relax</b> for a moment - your
       (installation) work is done!</li>
  </ol>
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="addons"></a>OSPRep Addons</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  And finally: The AddOns. Starting with v0.4.x, the AddOns are already
  converted from "anonymous blocks" to "stored procedures" - which means, in
  order to use them, you need to install the osprep package into the database.
  If you did not install them with the <code>spcreate.sh</code> script
  described above, this can be done as follows:
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  <ol>
   <li>Change to the install/database/ subdirectory of your OSPRep installation</li>
   <li>Invoke Sql*Plus and connect as the statspack user (perfstat)</li>
   <li>Run the following command:<br><code>@pkg_osprep.sql</code></li>
  </ol>

 <tr><td class="text">
  Now that you succeeded up to this point, continue with the
  <a href="usage.html">usage</a> page to read important things about how to
  call the <code>~/scripts/sreport.sh</code>, <code>~scripts/charts.sh</code> and
  <code>~/scripts/fts_plans.sh</code> scripts. Maybe after a while you want to
  fine-tune your setup: read more about that on the
  <a href="config.html">configuration</a> page.
