 <tr><th>Configuration</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Since the configuration file is executed as a shell script, we have to stick to
  Shell rules here - i.e., no spaces left or right to the equal sign: the syntax
  is strictly "<code>var=value</code>". Do not ever remove or comment out any
  configuration lines, even if you want to use OraRep's defaults, since this may
  lead to misbehaviour. The script relies on the settings are made in the config
  file.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="required"></a>Required Settings</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  The configuration shipped with OraRep already contains useful default values
  for most settings.  However, there are some values the developer cannot know
  or set up to auto-run on every system, such as usernames, passwords, the
  database name or the target directory to store the reports in. So these are
  the minimum of settings you have to make in order for OraRep to run properly:
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  <table align="center" width="95%">
   <tr><th class="th_sub2">Variable</th><th class="th_sub2">Explanation</th></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>ORACLE_SID</code></td>
       <td class="text">As already known from the Oracle setup, the <code>ORACLE_SID</code>
           is the Service IDentifier for a given database instance. In the
           context of OraRep, the SID is additionally used to generate the
           file names for the database report files, which will be called
           <CODE>&lt;ORACLE_SID&gt;.html</CODE>. If you did not specify a
           separate <i>connection string</i> (see the command line parameter "-c"
           in the <a href="usage.html#cmdline">Usage</a> section of this
           documentation), this value is also used to connect to the database.</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>user</code></td>
       <td class="text" rowspan="2">The user and password to connect to the
           database. Although you may override these settings using the command
           line parameters "-u" and "-p", this is not recommended for the password
           on manual calls, since the entire command line can be made visible by
           any user e.g. with the <code>ps</code> command, and thus the password
           can be sniffed. So better specify it inside the script and protect the
           file against unauthorized access. If you need different user/password
           combinations, the recommendation is to use different config files,
           which you then can specify on the command line using the "-c" switch.</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>password</code></td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>TMPDIR</code></td>
       <td class="text">Directory to place temporary files into (these files will
           be removed at the end of the run of the script). The default setting,
           <code>/tmp</code>, should be fine for most systems. Just ensure that
           the <code>/tmp</code> directory is available on your system ;-)</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>REPDIR</code></td>
       <td class="text">The directory where the reports (HTML) should be written
           to. Below this directory you created the "help" directory when
           following the installation instructions supplied with this documentation.</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>CSS</code></td>
       <td class="text">Name of the StyleSheet the HTML reports should use, with
           relative path (if any). An example StyleSheet file, containing all
           classes needed/used by OraRep, is provided in the <code>reports/</code>
           directory of the archive.</td></tr>

  Once you are familiar with the reports generated by OraRep, you may want to
  fine-tune it a bit to better suit your requirements. For this issue, the
  config file provides some more settings which are to be explained here:

   <tr><th class="th_sub2">Variable</th><th class="th_sub2">Explanation</th></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>TOP_N_WAITS</code></td>
       <td class="text" rowspan="2">How many items to list up in the "Top N"
           blocks of the report for Wait objects and tables (the latter in the
           Miscellaneous block at the end of the report)</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>TOP_N_TABLES</code></td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>MK_RSRC</code></td>
       <td class="text">Resource plans are a useful feature or Oracle to manage
           your resources - e.g. to insure that administrators will gain the
           needed resources such as CPU even when the database is under high
           load. However, if you do not make use of these, you probably don't
           want to read reports on this topic (i.e. what roles exist and what
           rules apply to them), so you may disable it by setting the value to
           zero (default). The initial resource group for each user is nevertheless
           displayed in the "User Information" block.</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>MK_TSQUOT</code></td>
       <td class="text">Whether to display all TableSpace quotas (default: 1,
           display quotas).</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>MK_DBAPROF</code></td>
       <td class="text">A user's profile limits database usage and instance
           resources. The report lists available profiles with their settings
           concerning resources and limits in this block. If you don't use
           profiles, or do not want to report on them, you may disable it here.</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>MK_FILES</code></td>
       <td class="text">Whether to report on the data files of the instances</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>MK_RBS</code></td>
       <td class="text">Include Rollback Segment Statistics with the report. This
           is somehow useless if you use automatic undo management (available
           since Oracle release 9)</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>MK_MEMVAL</code></td>
       <td class="text">This controls the "Memory Values" block which just lists
           all memory areas and their sizes (not the pool statistics - see next
           item)</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>MK_POOL</code></td>
       <td class="text">The Pool Statistics list the available pool areas with
           their sizes, the free space available at the time the report is
           generated as well as some statistics like cache hit ratios.</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>MK_BUFFRAT</code></td>
       <td class="text">The "Buffer Wait Ratios" block helps you to identify the
           type of the <code>buffer busy waits</code> (if any) that are listed in
           the "Selected Wait Events" block. You should activate this if you
           encounter many <code>buffer busy waits</code> and want to know what
           tuning actions are reasonable.</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name"><code>MK_ENQ</code></td>
       <td class="text">The "Enqueue Waits" block may be useful for closer
           investigation if other results indicate problems concerning enqueues,
           but may not be needed for the daily reports in most cases.</td></tr>
