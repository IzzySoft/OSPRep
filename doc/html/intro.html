  OSPRep is an Oracle Statspack Report Generator, used to create reports about your
  database activity statistics in a nice, human readable format - which in this
  case is HTML -, based on the data collected by Oracle Statspack. The generated
  report provides you with information on the physical database design (tablespaces,
  datafiles, memory), statistical values on your databases efficiency and more.
  It is highly configurable concerning the report elements you need. Due to its
  modular design, only the needed code (depending on the options you chose in
  the config file) will be build and executed, to save your database from
  unnecessary load.

 <tr><td class="text">
  OSPRep reads its data out of the (level 5 and 6) statistics gathered by the
  <code>statspack.snap()</code> procedure of Oracle Statspack. Analogue to the
  ASCII report one may generate using Oracle Statspack's <code>spreport.sql</code>,
  OSPrep generates HTML reports out of these data. Additional to this, there are
  some plugins available (located within the <code>install/</code> directory of
  the distribution) to gather more information (which is not provided by Oracle
  Statspack itself) and report on those, e.g. datafile growth and wait events.<br>
  Together with these data, OSPRep gives some descriptions on their meaning as
  well as ideas what they may point to or what actions are required from the DBA
  in order to bring the instance to a more efficient state. For some issues,
  even code pieces for possible required actions are given.<br>
  Another useful thing to mention here is the <code>fts_plans.sh</code> script
  provided by OSPrep, which can be used to gather execution plans for all SQL
  statements executed during a certain period of time, having caused full table
  scans (FTS). This way OSPRep gives you the statements on your finger tips to
  start the tuning of your applications.

 <tr><td class="text">
  OSPRep will take no (write) actions to the database (only things that
  OSPRep writes are the HTML report pages and some temporary files; the latter
  ones are automatically removed when the script finishes). It only does report
  what it finds in the database plus some general description on those values. It
  gives no "perfect solution" to problems that may exist with your instance, just
  hints to what may be helpful. It will not repair or tune your database for you:
  in order to have this done, you must draw your own conclusions out of the report
  results.
