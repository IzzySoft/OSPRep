  OSPRep is an Oracle Statspack Report Generator, used to create reports about your
  database activity statistics in a nice, human readable format - which in this
  case is HTML -, based on the data collected by Oracle Statspack and, optionally,
  some <a href="tech.html#plugins">plugins</a> shipped with OSPRep. The generated
  report provides you with information on the physical database design (tablespaces,
  datafiles, memory), statistical values on your databases efficiency and more.
  It is highly configurable not only concerning the report elements you need. Due
  to its modular design, only the needed code (depending on the options you chose
  in the config file) will be build and executed, to save your database from
  unnecessary load.

 <tr><td class="text">
  OSPRep reads its data out of the (level 5 - 7) statistics gathered by the
  <code>statspack.snap()</code> procedure of Oracle Statspack and the corresponding
  procedures from above mentioned <a href="tech.html#plugins">plugins</a>.
  Analogue to the ASCII report one may generate using Oracle Statspack's
  <code>spreport.sql</code>, OSPrep generates HTML reports out of these data.
  The additional information gathered (and reported) by the mentioned plugins
  includes e.g. datafile growth and wait events.<br>
  Together with these data, OSPRep gives some descriptions on their meaning as
  well as ideas what they may point to or what actions are required from the DBA
  in order to bring the instance to a more efficient state. For some issues,
  even code pieces for possible required actions are given.<br>
  Other useful things to mention here are the <code>fts_plans.sh</code> script
  provided by OSPrep, which can be used to gather execution plans for all SQL
  statements executed during a certain period of time, having caused full table
  scans (FTS) - and the <code>charts.sh</code> script, generating some simple
  charts for selected statistics. This way OSPRep gives you the information on
  your finger tips to start the tuning of your applications.

 <tr><td class="text">
  OSPRep will take no (write) actions to the database (only things that
  OSPRep writes are the HTML report pages and some temporary files; the latter
  ones are automatically removed when the script finishes). It only does report
  what it finds in the database plus some general description on those values. It
  gives no "perfect solution" to problems that may exist with your instance, just
  hints to what may be helpful. It will not repair or tune your database for you:
  in order to have this done, you must draw your own conclusions out of the report
  results.
