  Called without any parameter, <code>sreport.sh</code> displays a short help
  page concerning its command line parameters. A normal, successful run can
  be done with just passing it the <code>ORACLE_SID</code> of the instance to
  report on as only parameter - provided your Oracle environment is set up to
  support a connect with the syntax "<code>CONNECT user/password@ORACLE_SID</code>".
  More command line parameters are available and listed in the table below:

           as e.g. running a complete report containing all blocks just once
           a week, while having a shorter everyday report), or for groups of
           instances you want to monitor the same blocks or having the same
           user/password combinations in, and then just specify the corresponding
           config file at the command line.</td></tr>

            <code>ORACLE_SID</code> is also used for the report's file name.</td></tr>

  An example command line could look like this:
  <table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
  <div class="code" style="width:40em">
    ./sreport.sh oradb -c maint.config -d /var/www/reports/oradb
  </div>
  </td></tr></table>
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="eval"></a>Evaluation of results</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Since database design and usage can differ a lot between different systems,
  there is no general recipe to success on the evaluation of the reports (not
  even on the configuration of OSPRep). Nevertheless, there are several places
  of the report that may deserve closer attention even on the first evaluation
  and/or by the novice admin.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  A good point to start is to see the "Instance Efficiency Percentage". In this
  section you can get a general idea on your database instances performance.
  Most items in this table provide you a link to the part of the report to
  continue with if problems are indicated by the efficiency percentage of the
  entry concerned.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Next, you may wish to evaluate the "Top 5 wait events". Again, here are links
  provided to guide you to other segments of the report giving you closer/further
  information on relevant topics.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  These are just some <b><i>ideas</i></b> of where to start and what to keep in
  mind. Of course, there are many more things to consider - but either you already
  know about these, you will learn about these, or you will find somebody else
  to tell you: this documentation is not intended to be a seminary on Oracle
  Performance Tuning, there are other sources on this. If OSPRep (with its
  documentation, reports and hints) got you started on this topic, or gave you
  new/more ideas about it, I did a good job :-)
