  Called without any parameter, <code>sreport.sh</code> displays a short help
  page concerning its command line parameters. A normal, successful run can
  be done with just passing it the <code>ORACLE_SID</code> of the instance to
  report on as only parameter - provided your Oracle environment is set up to
  support a connect with the syntax "<code>CONNECT user/password@ORACLE_SID</code>".
  More command line parameters are available and listed in the table below:

           instances you want to monitor the same blocks or having the same

 <tr><td>
  An example command line could look like this:
  <table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
  <div class="code" style="width:42em">
    ./sreport.sh oradb -c maint.config -d /var/www/reports/oradb
  </div>
  </td></tr></table>
 </td></tr>

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="ftsplan"></a>fts_plans.sh</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  For the <code>fts_plans.sh</code> script, the same command line syntax applies.
  You may want to use this script, if you have many <code>data file sequential
  reads</code>, and the "Wait Objects" segments of OSPRep's report indicates that
  this is because of too many full table scans (FTS). <code>fts_plans.sh</code>
  retrieves the latest execution plans for all statements that caused full table
  scans (i.e., if the latest execution plan indicates FTS) for the given interval.
  If your database already has a long uptime, you may be forced to specify a
  snapshot range (this is due to a limitation in PL/SQL: the dbms_output
  package is limited to 1000000 chars). In this case, specify the <code>END_ID</code>
  taken from the report's "SnapShot Info" block, and specify a <code>BEGIN_ID</code>
  that is between "<code>END_ID</code> -1" and "<code>END_ID</code> -120" (i.e.
  up to 5 days in the past) -- depending on your database size and traffic you
  may have to experiment a bit with those values. Of course, these are only guiding
  values - there may be cases to specify an <code>BEGIN_ID</code> that is earlier
  than 5 days before the <code>START_ID</code> -- I leave this choice up to you :-)
 </td></tr>

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="charts"></a>charts.sh</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Use this script to create charts for selected statistics. It has the same
  command line syntax as the other scripts, and creates its pages in the
  configured <code>REPDIR</code>, using the file name <code>&lt;ORACLE_SID&gt;_chart.html</code>.
  The charts themselves are created via JavaScript - so there are no additional
  requirements like a graphics engine. Only your browser has to support JavaScript,
  which most browsers will. I tested it with M$IE and Mozilla Firefox in Windows,
  plus with Mozilla in Linux.
 </td></tr>

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="eval"></a>Evaluation of results</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Since database design and usage can differ a lot between different systems,
  there is no general recipe to success on the evaluation of the reports (not
  even on the configuration of OSPRep). Nevertheless, there are several places
  of the report that may deserve closer attention even on the first evaluation
  and/or by the novice admin.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub2"><a name="eval"></a>Charts</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  The charts generated by <code>charts.sh</code> will let you know whether there
  are continous or sporadic problems. There are three different chart types
  available: cumulative, differential (delta) and ratio. The Cumul and Delta
  charts focus on timeouts of system events (from the system events are only
  timeouts evaluated for now), while Ratio charts mainly focus on sysstat.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  For the Cumul stats, as the name already may suggest, the graph will either be a
  horizontal line, or the values will increase. The Delta stats are based on the
  same values as the Cumul stats, but the diagram shows the difference between
  the snapshots. And last but not least, the Ratio charts provide diagrams on
  some important ratios (that's why they are named such), plus some other
  statistics like logon counts.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Problem zones are most easy to identify using the Cumul and Ratio charts. The
  longer the interval between the first and the last snapshot evaluated gets,
  the more useless the Delta charts become: with really large intervals, they
  look like someone just brushed the screen :-) But they may be really useful
  for short intervals.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub2"><a name="eval"></a>Reports: Go4Colors</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  For a quick survey of your databases values, you can use the "Go4Colors" mode:
  just open the report and scroll through it looking for the colors "red" and
  "yellow" (refering to the default stylesheet shipped with OSPRep). If there's
  no cell with one of those background colors, there should be no problems. If
  there is, you may wanna stop to investigate at this point. See the section on
  <a href="#go4colors" title="Go4Colors">Go4Colors</a> below for more details.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub2"><a name="eval"></a>Reports: Detailled</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  A good point to start is to see the "Instance Efficiency Percentage". In this
  section you can get a general idea on your database instances performance.
  Most items in this table provide you a link to the part of the report to
  continue with if problems are indicated by the efficiency percentage of the
  entry concerned.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Next, you may wish to evaluate the "Top 5 wait events". Again, here are links
  provided to guide you to other segments of the report giving you closer/further
  information on relevant topics.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  These are just some <b><i>ideas</i></b> of where to start and what to keep in
  mind. Of course, there are many more things to consider - but either you already
  know about these, you will learn about these, or you will find somebody else
  to tell you: this documentation is not intended to be a seminary on Oracle
  Performance Tuning, there are other sources on this. If OSPRep (with its
  documentation, reports and hints) got you started on this topic, or gave you
  new/more ideas about it, I did a good job :-)
 </td></tr>

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="go4colors"></a>Go4Colors</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  The "Go4Colors Mode" is intended to highlight possible problems in order to
  not overlook them. As a side effect, the DBA that supervises many instances
  has a quick way to determine whether there are possible problems that need
  his attention without reading the whole report. However, one should not rely
  on these colors, since they are mostly based on arbitrary values: again we have
  no perfect recipe on what "regular values" should look like - and a value
  suitable in an OLTP environment already could indicate issues for tuning in
  a batch environment, and vice versa.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Normally, a table cell with yellow background indicates a "warning", red
  background means "alert". But again, you shouldn't take these indicators
  literally: everything very much depends on your environment. So even a cell
  with red background doesn't mean you have to panic!
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  The values that lead to a "warning" or "alert" are at this time hard coded.
  Maybe with a future release I will separate them into configurable files, so
  we could even have one file for OLTP and one for Batch, plus everybody could
  define his/her own one... But right now, this is not the case. So if you want
  to know what values are defined, please refer to the following table:
